# season-planner

## Describe how the system is personally meaningful to you.
This system is personally meaningful to me because I am an indecisive person, and it takes me a huge amount of planning to be able to do a certain activity. This system get rids of indecisive and instead give me random dates that I should do the activity. It does not require much effort, and all the activities are the ones I love to do during a certain season. Furthermore it is a planner with a lot of flexibility in which the date could be randomizes if chosen again.


## Challenges I faced
I have not coded in a long time because the computer science class I have taken were all mostly on theoretical base. It was outside my comfort zone to work on the entire project by myself. I created a function to generates the transition matrix with random activities, random dates within a specific season, and their corresponding probability. 


## Important aspect
It was important challenge for me to learn how the transition matrix will work outside the context that we discussed in class. Additionally, I think it is an important skill to learn how to go through the pseudo coding, debugging, and learning how to use google as a troubleshooting method. I have only coded for assignment projects with a specific goal which I did not find interesting. Whereas this project challenged me to develop my own project design and objective which I found more stimulating. 

## Next steps
In this project I would want to implement more user input and make a plot in a style of a calendar. I would ask for more feedback from my peers, and I feel in some part my code has more element than it requires so I would put more clarifications.

## Creative?
Personally, this system is creative as it changed my thoughts on how I could use matrix to recommend me I believe my system is creative because inputting a transition matrix, it generates the matrix and its probability randomly. While there are AI recommendation generator, I donâ€™t believe I have seen one that includes visuals. This process involves a level of randomness and variation that can be seen as a form of creativeness. The visual component adds a new dimension to the generated content making it more engaging. 

## Credits
I want to credit my colleagues Lily Hyunh and Khue Anh Tran for giving me feedback on my project ideas and helping me debug errors in my code.
